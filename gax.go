// Package gax contains a set of modules which aid the development of APIs
// for clients and servers based on gRPC and Google API conventions.
//
// Application code will rarely need to use this library directly.
// However, code generated automatically from API definition files can use it
// to simplify code generation and to provide more convenient and idiomatic API surfaces.
package gax

// Version specifies the gax version.
